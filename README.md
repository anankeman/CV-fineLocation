fine-geolocate images


Geolocation is the problem of localising a person or device in the world using sensor data. Depending
on the device, the environment, and the level of accuracy required, geolocation may rely on GPS
coordinates, network routing addresses, or image data. Geolocation is an important problem in many
AI and computing applications, from autonomous vehicle navigation to search engine queries based
on the user’s current location (e.g., “restaurants near me”).

This project will investigate the problem of fine-grained geolocation in a small indoor/outdoor
environment (an art museum). Image information is particularly important for this type of problem,
because other sources of information, like GPS, may not be accurate enough to provide fine-grained
position data and may not be able to distinguish between different floors in indoor environments.
